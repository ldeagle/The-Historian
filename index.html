<p style="color:blue; font-family:verdana; font-size:200%;text-align:center;">John Field, an Irish immigrant to the city of Boston, was a successful leatherworker and innkeeper during Boston’s revolutionary transformation. While producing leather breeches while running a busy inn with his wife Catherin, the Fields’ Court Street residence would serve both as a place of business, a home to their five children as well as an inn for a growing number of apprentices, employees and guests.  While his wife Catherine was a steadfast sympathizer for the Patriot cause, John would remain neutral throughout the tumultuous years of the British occupation of Boston from 1775-1776, in which he and his family would remain in the town while others fled to Patriot territory.  On the night of March 5, 1770, Mr. Field upon hearing word of British soldiers and young apprentices brawling in the streets of Boston urged his employees and guests to proceed with caution if they were to find themselves on the streets of Boston during the evening.  One employee, a fellow Irishman and leatherworker Patrick Carr, upon heeding the advice of his landlord and employer would return later than evening with a wound to the hip received from a stray musket ball fired by a group of British soldiers standing guard in front of the Customs House.  In an event later referred to as the “Boston Massacre,” Carr would later succumb to his wound following days of care he would receive from both his employer Mr. Field and local physician Dr. John Jefferies, who would both later provide valuable testimony in the prosecution of the British soldiers involved in this fatal altercation.</p>
